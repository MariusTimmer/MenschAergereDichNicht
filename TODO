A simple action can be transported from the gui over the board and the
gameinterface to the game itself. It is able to increase the position of a
selected figure without updating the gui. TODO:
+ Update the new position of a figure in the gui
+ Let the gamelogic check if the figure is able to move and if a other
  figure will be replaced.
